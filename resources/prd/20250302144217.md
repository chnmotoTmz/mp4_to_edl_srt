## Refined Requirements

Generate a Python script that takes a folder path as input, containing MP4 files. For each MP4 file, it extracts the audio, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper, segments the audio based on a silence threshold, performs configurable scene analysis, displays scene analysis progress, and generates an EDL and SRT file embedding meaningful scene information alongside the transcription. The frame rate is 30 fps non-drop frame. Time codes are HH:MM:SS:FF for EDL and HH:MM:SS,MMM for SRT.

## Project Name

mp4_to_edl_srt_with_scene_analysis

## Refined Product Goals

- Create a robust script for converting MP4 audio to EDL and SRT formats, including advanced scene analysis.
- Automate the process of transcribing and segmenting audio, with scene-aware segmentation and metadata.
- Provide clear and accurate time-coded transcriptions, including scene metadata derived from analysis.
- Enable configurable scene analysis to adapt to different video types and user needs.
- Offer a transparent and informative user experience during scene analysis processing.
- Embed meaningful and useful scene information in the generated EDL and SRT files for video editors.

## Refined User Stories

- As a video editor, I want a script to automatically generate EDL files from MP4 files, including scene information derived from analysis.
- As a content creator, I want to easily transcribe audio from my videos, with segmentation that considers scene changes.
- As a user, I want the script to handle various audio file formats and produce accurate time-coded transcriptions, including scene metadata.
- As a user, I want to be able to configure whether scene analysis is performed to control processing time and output detail.
- As a user, I want to see progress updates specifically for the scene analysis process.
- As a user, I want the scene information in the output files (EDL/SRT) to be meaningful and help me navigate the video.

## Competitive Analysis

- Existing manual EDL creation tools: Time-consuming and prone to errors, no automation or scene analysis.
- Other automated transcription tools: May not provide word-level timestamps, scene information, or configurable analysis.
- FFmpeg and Whisper API integrations: May require complex scripting, lack integrated scene analysis and structured output.
- Tools lacking scene analysis capabilities: Will not provide scene-aware segmentation or scene metadata in output.
- Tools with basic scene detection: May not provide meaningful descriptions, configurable options, or integrate info into standard formats like EDL/SRT.
- Dedicated scene detection software: Often separate tools, not integrated with transcription/EDL/SRT generation.

## Refined Requirement Analysis

- The script needs to handle multiple MP4 files, extract audio, transcribe using Whisper, segment based on silence, generate EDL and SRT files with accurate time codes, and handle potential errors.
- Crucially, it needs to incorporate scene analysis using frame extraction and image classification.
- Scene analysis must be configurable (enable/disable) via user settings.
- The script must display progress updates specifically for the scene analysis phase.
- Meaningful scene information derived from the analysis needs to be embedded in the generated EDL and SRT files.
- This requires integrating computer vision libraries (OpenCV) and potentially deep learning frameworks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) for classification.
- Consideration is needed for model selection, download mechanisms, and balancing analysis speed with accuracy.
- The implementation requires a new module for scene analysis and modifications to existing modules for integration and output formatting.
- The GUI needs updates for the configuration option and progress display.
- The scene analysis process should extract frames, classify them, detect changes, and generate descriptive metadata.

## Refined Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Extract audio from MP4 files using FFmpeg.']
- ['P0', "Transcribe audio using OpenAI's Whisper API."]
- ['P0', 'Generate EDL file with accurate time codes, including scene metadata.']
- ['P0', 'Generate SRT file with accurate time codes, including scene metadata.']
- ['P1', 'Implement scene analysis using OpenCV for frame extraction and image classification.']
- ['P1', 'Enable configurable scene analysis (on/off).']
- ['P1', 'Display progress during scene analysis.']

## UI Design draft

A simple configuration option (e.g., checkbox or dropdown) to enable/disable scene analysis. A progress bar or status indicator specifically for the scene analysis phase, possibly showing frame processing progress or scene detection status (e.g., 'Analyzing frame X/Y', 'Detecting scenes...'). A clear display of scene information (e.g., 'Scene: [Description]') in the generated EDL and SRT files, likely as comments or specific markers.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The exact format for embedding scene information in EDL and SRT files (e.g., comment lines, specific tags). The level of detail and type of description for scene information (e.g., "Outdoor", "Indoor", "Close-up", "Wide Shot", "Action Scene", "Dialogue Scene", or more specific descriptions). How to balance analysis speed and accuracy, especially for long videos or rapid scene changes. Specific pre-trained models suitable for general scene classification in diverse video content and their licensing/distribution.
