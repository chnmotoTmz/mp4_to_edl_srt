## Original Requirements

create : Generate a Python script that does the following: Takes a folder path as input, containing MP4 files. For each MP4 file in the folder: a. Extracts the audio using FFmpeg. b. Uses Open AI's Whisper to transcribe the audio and get word-level time stamps. c. Groups the words into segments based on a silence threshold of 0.5 seconds between words. d. For each segment, records the start and end time codes in the original MP4 file. Generates a CMX 3600 EDL file with: Title: 'My Video Project' FCM: 'NON-DROP FRAME' Each event corresponding to a segment, with: Event number: incremental starting from 001 Reel name: 'TAPE' followed by a two-digit number (e.g., TAPE01 for the first file, based on file order) Track type: 'AA/V' (assuming both audio and video are present) Transition: 'C' for cut Source time codes: start and end time codes of the segment in the original MP4 file (HH:MM:SS:FF format, 30fps non-drop frame) Record time codes: sequential in the timeline, starting from 00:00:00:00, with each subsequent segment starting where the previous ends Comment: '* FROM CLIP NAME: filename.mp4' Generates an SRT file for all segments across all MP4 files, containing: Index: incremental starting from 1 Time codes: start --> end in HH:MM:SS,MMM format Transcription: the text from Whisper for that segment Assumptions: The frame rate is 30 fps non-drop frame. The time codes are in HH:MM:SS:FF format for EDL and HH:MM:SS,MMM for SRT. Dependencies: Open AI's Whisper API, FFmpeg for audio extraction, Python libraries for handling time codes and file operations. The script should be well-documented and include error handling for cases like missing files or API errors.

## Project Name

mp4_to_edl_srt

## Product Goals

- Create a robust script for converting MP4 audio to EDL and SRT formats.
- Automate the process of transcribing and segmenting audio.
- Provide clear and accurate time-coded transcriptions.

## User Stories

- As a video editor, I want a script to automatically generate EDL files from MP4 files.
- As a content creator, I want to easily transcribe audio from my videos.
- As a user, I want the script to handle various audio file formats and produce accurate time-coded transcriptions.

## Competitive Analysis

- Existing manual EDL creation tools: Time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Other automated transcription tools: May not provide word-level timestamps.
- FFmpeg and Whisper API integrations: May require complex scripting.

## Competitive Quadrant Chart



## Requirement Analysis

The script needs to handle multiple MP4 files, extract audio, transcribe using Whisper, segment based on silence, generate EDL and SRT files with accurate time codes, and handle potential errors.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Extract audio from MP4 files using FFmpeg.']
- ['P0', "Transcribe audio using OpenAI's Whisper API."]
- ['P0', 'Segment audio based on silence threshold.']
- ['P0', 'Generate EDL file with accurate time codes.']
- ['P0', 'Generate SRT file with accurate time codes.']

## UI Design draft

No UI is required, as this is a script for command-line or automated use.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Specific error handling mechanisms and the format for handling different file names need further clarification.
