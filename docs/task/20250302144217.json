The `Segment` class in `segment.py` encapsulates the timecode and transcription for a single segment.  `edl_data.py` and `srt_data.py` handle the structure of the output EDL and SRT files, respectively.  Error handling is crucial and should be implemented using `try...except` blocks throughout the code.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Input folder structure and expected file naming conventions (e.g., how to extract the filename from the input MP4 file) are needed.  Specific error handling mechanisms (e.g., how to handle cases where Whisper fails to transcribe) should be detailed.  Also, the expected format of the timecode (e.g., HH:MM:SS:FF) needs to be defined."}
