### User Experience Requirements 1. Configurable: Users should be able to enable/disable scene analysis 2. Transparent: Show progress and status of scene analysis in the GUI 3. Informative: Generated scene information should be meaningful and useful for video editors ## Implementation Details ### Required New Components 1. Create a new module scene_analyzer.py for frame extraction and image classification 2. Extend existing classes to incorporate scene information ### Core Functionality to Implement 1. Frame Extraction: Methods to extract frames at specified intervals using OpenCV or similar libraries 2. Scene Classification: Integration with pre-trained models (using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar frameworks) 3. Content Analysis: Logic to analyze consecutive frames and detect scene changes or significant content shifts 4. EDL Enhancement: Extensions to the EDL format to include scene metadata ### Model Selection 1. Recommend specific pre-trained models suitable for scene classification 2. Consider model size, accuracy, and inference speed 3. Support offline operation if possible, with simple model download mechanisms ### Integration Points 1. How the scene analysis should be triggered in the processing pipeline 2. How scene information should be stored alongside audio transcription 3. How the GUI should be updated to accommodate the new features ## Deliverables 1. New module(s) for scene analysis 2. Modified existing modules to integrate scene information 3. Updated GUI with new options 4. Documentation on how to use the new features 5. Requirements for any additional dependencies ## Additional Considerations 1. How to handle videos with rapid scene changes 2. Balancing analysis accuracy with processing speed 3. Making scene descriptions human-readable and useful 4. Supporting multiple languages for scene descriptions ## Implementation Example Please provide a structural overview of how this feature should be implemented, including: 1. New class and method definitions 2. Changes to existing code 3. Example of how scene information would appear in EDL and SRT files 4. Required dependencies and installation instructions 5. Suggested pre-trained models with their pros and cons
