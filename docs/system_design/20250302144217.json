{"Implementation approach":"We will use Python's `subprocess` module to interact with FFmpeg, the `whisper` library for transcription, and custom functions for time code manipulation and EDL/SRT generation.  Error handling will be implemented using `try...except` blocks to catch potential issues with file access, FFmpeg execution, Whisper API calls, and time code parsing.  A clear structure will be used to manage data flow and ensure robustness.","File list":["main.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MP4File {\n        -filepath: str\n        -audio_filepath: str\n        -transcription: str\n        -segments: list\n        +extract_audio(): None\n        +transcribe(): None\n        +segment_audio(threshold: float): None\n        +generate_edl_data(): dict\n        +generate_srt_data(): dict\n    }\n    class Segment {\n        -start_timecode: str\n        -end_timecode: str\n        -transcription: str\n        +__init__(start_timecode: str, end_timecode: str, transcription: str): None\n    }\n    class EDLData {\n        -title: str\n        -fcm: str\n        -events: list\n        +__init__(title: str, fcm: str): None\n        +add_event(event: dict): None\n    }\n    class SRTData {\n        -segments: list\n        +__init__(): None\n        +add_segment(segment: dict): None\n    }\n```","Program call flow":"```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Main as Main\n    participant MP4File as MP4File\n    participant Segment as Segment\n    participant EDLData as EDLData\n    participant SRTData as SRTData\n    Main->>MP4File: process_folder(folder_path)\n    activate MP4File\n    MP4File->>MP4File: extract_audio()\n    MP4File->>MP4File: transcribe()\n    MP4File->>MP4File: segment_audio(0.5)\n    loop over each segment\n        MP4File->>Segment: create Segment object\n        MP4File->>Segment: populate Segment data\n    end\n    MP4File->>EDLData: generate_edl_data()\n    MP4File->>SRTData: generate_srt_data()\n    deactivate MP4File\n    Main->>EDLData: write_edl_file(edl_data)\n    Main->>SRTData: write_srt_file(srt_data)\n```","Anything UNCLEAR":"The exact format for handling different file names (e.g., how to extract the filename from the input MP4 file) and specific error handling mechanisms (e.g., how to handle cases where Whisper fails to transcribe) need further clarification.  Also, the input folder structure and expected file naming conventions should be defined."}
